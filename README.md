# dotfiles

Repository of all my dotfiles. Uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks.

## Fresh install

Repo must exist in the $HOME directory in order to install correctly. To do a
fresh install of all scripts:

```bash
./do-install
```

## Clean all

```bash
./clean-env
```
